================

Last updated: September 4, 2014

## General Information
This is a Drupal module that can be used to search and embed HHS Digital Media 
content.  It has been built and tested on Drupal 7.28.  It is based on the 
pure HTML & Javascript module found 
[Here](https://github.com/HHSDigitalMediaAPIPlatform/HHSDigitalMediaModuleHTML).

## Installation & Setup
Install the module found at /install/hhs_digital_media_syndication.zip like 
you would install any other Drupal module.  Once installed you should find 
a new module type called *HHS Digital Media Syndication*, enable the module 
and configure to create pages and blocks of syndicated content.

## Use
Click on the Configure link for the *HHS Digital Media Syndication* module from 
the /admin/modules screen.  Here you can add new syndicated items, or edit and 
delete existing items.  In the syndicated item editor form start by entering a 
*Title*, then select a *Source* for the content.  That will populate supported 
media types and topics from that source.  Use the *From Date*, *Media Types*, 
and *Topics* fields to filter the list of available titles.  Select a title to 
see a preview of the syndicated content.  There are also display options for 
controlling the display of the content.  Any display settings that affect the 
title selected will cause the preview to refresh.
